            <p>Hi, my name is Denys!</p>
            <p>I am an aspiring blockchain developer deeply passionate about the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.</p>
            <p>Studying different blockchain architectures and prototyping a decentralized exchange, implementing an auction mechanism and developing smart contracts are part of my blockchain experience. I have also mastered frontend development in React and worked with Solidity, Hardhat, Ganache and ethers.js.</p>
            <p>All my work reflects my interest in exploring and creating projects using blockchain. Since the beginning of my career, I have been focused on continuous improvement and creating innovations in this field. I am ready for new challenges and strive to actively participate in the dynamic and evolving blockchain community.</p>
