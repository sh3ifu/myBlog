### About

Hi, my name is Denys!

I am an aspiring blockchain developer deeply passionate about the possibilities of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

Studying different blockchain architectures and prototyping a decentralized exchange, implementing an auction mechanism and developing smart contracts are part of my blockchain experience. I have also mastered frontend development in React and worked with Solidity, Hardhat, Ganache and ethers.js.

All my work reflects my interest in exploring and creating projects using blockchain. Since the beginning of my career, I have been focused on continuous improvement and creating innovations in this field. I am ready for new challenges and strive to actively participate in the dynamic and evolving blockchain community.
